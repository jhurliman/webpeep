# webpeep
A pluggable auralizer for the web. Demo: https://jhurliman.github.io/webpeep/

webpeep is inspired by the original [Peep Network Auralizer](http://peep.sourceforge.net/intro.html), turning streams of metrics such as network activity into ambient sound.

### Key Differences

1. Runs entirely in a browser using JavaScript.
2. 3D audio spatialization using [Songbird](https://google.github.io/songbird/).
3. Pluggable architecture allowing different data sources and programmatic
   mapping from events to sounds.
